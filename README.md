# Arc-Standard-Oracle
This program takes dependency parases in simplified CONLL format and determines the transitions that correspond to the sentence. I opted to create an oracle function and utilized a list to store the configuration. As items shift onto the stack, they are compared with head indices and word
indices of both the items already in the stack and those remaining in the buffer to determine a transition. I created an attachment function that scans the buffer for possible children, specifically for right arc transitions. Once a transition has been determined, the proper transition is printed to the sequence output file. Items are then either inserted or deleted from the stack.
